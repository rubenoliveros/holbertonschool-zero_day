## I Still Don't Know What To Do

I hope you go easy on me for this one... What is supposed to be here? An explanation on how to use Git / GitHub? I don't think so.

But I did:

1. Navigate to your my directory.
2. Create a directory holbertonschool-zero_day.
3. Navigate to the new directory I created.
4. Initialize git and add the remote origin https://github.com/rubenoliveros/holbertonschool-zero_day.git
5. Create a file README.md with Emacs and filled with all this

Just for the sake of teaching myself Markdown, let's try to put **these letters*[^1] in bold and *these ones*[^2]in italic.
